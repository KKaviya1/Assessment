EXPLANATION:
------------

Add Teacher: 
Users can add new teacher records to the system by entering the teacher's ID, name, and class and section details. 
The application stores this information in a text file for future reference.

Update Teacher: 
Existing teacher records can be updated by specifying the teacher's ID. 
Users can then provide updated information for the teacher's name and class and section. 
The application searches for the specified teacher ID and updates the information accordingly in the text file.

Retrieve Teacher: 
Users can retrieve teacher information by providing the teacher's ID. 
The application searches for the teacher's ID in the text file and displays the corresponding teacher's details, including ID, name, and class and section.

Design and Implementation:
-------------------------- 

Teacher Class:
The Teacher class defines the structure of a teacher record with three properties: ID, Name, and ClassAndSection.

TeacherManagementSystem Class:
This class handles the core functionality of adding, updating, retrieving, and managing teacher records.
It maintains a list of Teacher objects to keep track of the teacher records currently loaded in memory.
The LoadTeacherData method reads teacher data from the text file and populates the list of Teacher objects.
The SaveTeacherData method writes the list of Teacher objects back to the text file after any changes are made.
The AddTeacher, UpdateTeacher, and RetrieveTeacher methods provide the corresponding functionality by interacting with the list of Teacher objects and the text file.

Program Class:
The Program class serves as the entry point of the application.
It initializes an instance of the TeacherManagementSystem class.
Inside a loop, the user is presented with a menu to choose from options to add, update, retrieve, or exit.
Based on the user's choice, the program interacts with the TeacherManagementSystem to perform the desired actions.

User Interaction:
Users are presented with a menu-driven interface that guides them through the available options:

Add Teacher: 
Users input the teacher's ID, name, and class and section details to add a new teacher record.
Update Teacher: 
Users provide the teacher's ID and new information to update an existing teacher record.
Retrieve Teacher: 
Users input the teacher's ID to retrieve and display the teacher's details.
Exit: 
Users can exit the application when they are done.
